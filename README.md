# Text-extractor-from-Screenshot
An application that takes a screenshot and extracts text from it involves two main steps:

Capturing a screenshot: Using libraries such as Pillow or pyautogui in Python.
Extracting text from the screenshot: Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with a library like Tesseract via pytesseract.
Here's a basic implementation in Python:

# Prerequisites:
1. Install required libraries:
pip install pillow pytesseract pyautogui

2. Install Tesseract OCR:
On Windows, download the installer from Tesseract's GitHub page.
On Linux, use your package manager: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr.
On macOS, use Homebrew: brew install tesseract.
